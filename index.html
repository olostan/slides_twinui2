    <comment slide="1">Twinfield UI: How to build large-scale enterprise SPA applications with AngularJS.</comment>
    <comment slide="3">In Twinfield we are building large web application </comment>
    <comment slide="4">We're constantly looking the way how
        make developing faster but keeping quality on very high level.</comment>
    <comment slide="5">We found the way: use MVVM pattern</comment>
    <comment slide="6">MVVM stands for "Model", "View" and "ViewModel"</comment>
    <comment slide="7">So why we decided that it is the best way?</comment>
    <comment slide="8">We sell capabilities, not visual controls or components</comment>
    <comment slide="9">More "pages" with unique components you produce, more waste is added into your application, as
      you can't sell these unique components.</comment>
    <comment slide="10">One of obvious solutions is to outsource this kind of things: let UI-specialized companies
      produce visual pages so you can concentrate on business value</comment>
    <comment slide="11">In this case you can face such problems, as: code quality. It can look perfect, but 
      inside you can find a lot of "strange" things. Spend resources on review? Again waste.</comment>
    <comment slide="12">Your product bound to decisions made not by you. Switching to something new
      can require rewriting "pages" that is your business value (not components!)
    </comment>
    <comment slide="13">Multiple platforms? Again you need to spend resources for each screen. Do you beleave in myth
      "write once, run everywhere"? 
    </comment>
    <comment slide="14">Let's try Divide And Conquer! More you devide, more freedom have each piece, but you rule them all.</comment>
    <comment slide="15">Business guys can concentrate on business entities, workflows. Let them think like there is no 
    any UI. Express User Stories not as screens, but as buisness workflow</comment>
    <comment slide="16">Visual designs should be recognisable (buyable) so you should hold
     from «very specific solutions for this specific screen» (Even if you really really want to!).
     Let designers (UX specialists) concentrate on solving usability tasks of your application, not
     tasks of some— specific screen (example: if I have an entity I want to edit, and this entity has
      non-fixed collection of data grouped by some meaning - Customer and Addresses).</comment>
    <comment slide="17">Let good skilled Front-End developers bind these things (and only them). Let them
    do what they are best to do: think how bind components, how to react on user interaction. Moving out
    burden from their shoulders can give them wings - best web solutions, technologies.</comment>
    <comment slide="19">Thats exaclty how we, in Twinfield understand MVVM concept!</comment>
    <comment slide="20">There are couple of simple rules everyone should follow</comment>
    <comment slide="21">We starting implementhing this principle at 2013.</comment>
    <comment slide="22">...and found couple of issues you should be aware of</comment>
    <comment slide="23">Though I like «lean way» of development software, but developing core parts require
     very careful design and implementation you can't skip</comment>
    <comment slide="28">In Twinfield we're trying to be constant-innovating, always trying to
     answer the question "Can we do better?"</comment>
    <comment slide="29">Core should be composable from different functional capabilities. It should
     detect common mistakes and adapt on VM/V/M. DRY. Clean dependencies.</comment>
    <comment slide="30">People should understand how to turn constraints into features</comment>
    <comment slide="31">Move involved people - more mature core and richer application is</comment>
    <comment slide="33">This is simplest view-model represending form with one input</comment>
    <comment slide="34">After processing by AngularJS, it is transformed more 
    classic "view model" as object. Note: there is no AngularJS-bindings. Just meta-information</comment>
    <comment slide="35">Later this object is used by view where actual binding is done.</comment>
    <comment slide="36">More complex example: there is a collection (repeater?). Again - no repeating, no 
      binding in ViewModel (there is no data yeat!). Note - we're switching context!</comment>
    <comment slide="37">Validation. It is not part of form specification, but can be defined out of form.
      View (Form in this example), can use these rules. Also these rules could be re-used. Note again: VM is
      converted to object, so you can reference other VMs without requiring any data form these VMs.
